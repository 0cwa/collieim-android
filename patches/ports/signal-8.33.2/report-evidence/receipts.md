# Report action receipts

These records describe the actual checks, not independent reruns on each
report profile. Replay proves recorded file input and output blobs. It does not
prove the full tested source tree was identical to a report profile.

## Formatting checks

Sixteen changes were checked in a PR4-derived source context at tree
`70f2eba69967c4a3ae82dd9204999feb1bd70f9b` with the tested candidate actions
applied; the complete tested tree is not pinned. This is not a resource-link
run on PR3. Each associated XML-event log records `XML_EVENTS_EQUAL`. Each
associated resource log shows `:app:processProdWebsiteDebugResources` executed
and `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, exit 0. The file blob identities and sequence are in
report metadata and the versioned action patches.

The command used JDK 21, the configured Android SDK, and `agent-heavy --
./gradlew --no-daemon --no-parallel --no-configuration-cache --max-workers=1
--dependency-verification=strict --init-script <test-worker-heap.init.gradle>
-Pkotlin.compiler.execution.strategy=in-process
'-Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx5g -Xms256m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g -Dcom.android.tools.r8.threadCount=1 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:hashCode=3'
:app:processProdWebsiteDebugResources`. Checks 15 and 16 used `--rerun`; their
original resource logs showed `UP-TO-DATE` and are superseded by the forced
executions. Check 15 was tested with change 16 reversed; check 16 was then
reapplied and checked separately. Source records in task scratch are
`xml-format-gates.tsv`, `xml-format-gates-notes.md`, and the numbered XML and
resource logs named by the metadata. Passing removal checks do not establish
necessity of any current hunk.

## Lexical checks

Seventy baseline files and 74 sequential restorations were individually
compiled using `aapt2 compile -o <output-dir> <relative-resource-path>` with
AAPT2 `9.4.0-15978811-linux`. Each recorded command exited 0 with empty output.
The inputs are the file blobs in the metadata; the baseline and final file
blobs match both report profiles. These are file-scoped compilation checks,
not full resource-link checks. The source record in task scratch is
`XML-LEXICAL-CHECK.tsv`, whose phase, hunk name, path and input blob identify
each command. The intermediate file blobs were reconstructed from the exact
recorded transformations and verified against that record; the versioned
patches make their replay independent of local dangling objects.
